# Azure AI Foundry Ethical Loan Evaluation Platform - Demo Script

## Introduction (1-2 minutes)

"Today I'm excited to demonstrate our Ethical Loan Evaluation Platform powered by Azure AI Foundry. This platform tackles a critical challenge in the financial sector: reducing bias in lending decisions while maintaining regulatory compliance and effective risk management.

Traditional lending algorithms often contain hidden biases that can unfairly disadvantage certain demographic groups. Azure AI Foundry helps financial institutions make more equitable decisions by focusing solely on financial factors relevant to loan repayment ability."

## Application Overview (1 minute)

"Let me walk you through our application:

- On the left side, you see the navigation menu with various sections including Loan Evaluation, Evaluation History, and more
- The main section is where we'll be conducting our loan evaluation today
- Notice the clean, professional interface with Azure AI Foundry branding throughout"

## Demonstration (3-4 minutes)

### Step 1: Filling out the Loan Application

"Let's evaluate a loan application:

- Here we have a standard loan application form
- I'll enter an annual income of $85,000
- The applicant is requesting a loan of $125,000
- They have a good credit score of 720
- Employment status is 'Employed'
- The applicant is female
- They have had 1 missed payment in their history

Note the toggle at the top that allows us to compare traditional evaluation with the AI-powered ethical evaluation."

### Step 2: Submit and Review Results

"Now I'll click 'Evaluate Loan Application' to see the results...

Here we can see a side-by-side comparison of the traditional evaluation versus the Azure AI Foundry ethical evaluation:

**Traditional Evaluation:**
- Notice it DENIED the loan despite good financial metrics
- The analysis shows acceptable income-to-loan ratio and credit score
- However, it flags 'Demographic Risk' as 'Higher than average'
- The assessment explicitly states 'Statistical correlations suggest higher risk'
- This is a clear case where historical biases are influencing the decision

**Ethical Evaluation from Azure AI Foundry:**
- The ethical evaluation APPROVED the loan
- It focused exclusively on financial factors:
  - Income sufficiently supports the loan amount
  - Credit score indicates good creditworthiness
  - Steady employment suggests income stability
  - Only one missed payment is considered manageable

**Key Differences:**
- The traditional model made assumptions based partly on demographic factors
- The Azure AI Foundry model focused purely on financial capacity to repay
- The ethical model identified a qualified borrower who would have been rejected by traditional methods"
